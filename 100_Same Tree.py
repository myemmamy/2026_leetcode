Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 

Example 1:


Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
Example 3:


Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104

#         self.left = left

class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def helper(n1,n2):
            if n1 and n2:
                if n1.val != n2.val:
                    return False
                else:
                    return helper(n1.left,n2.left) and helper(n1.right, n2.right) 
            elif not n1 and not n2:
                return True
            else:
                return False
        return helper(p,q)
